##  👋 Welcome to Openlane!

**Openlane brings clarity, control, and automation to modern compliance**

We're developing a developer-first compliance automation platform to help growing companies get compliant, manage risks, and meet evolving regulatory or legal requirements.

Our passion is helping rapid-growth companies get compliant faster -- with fewer spreadsheets and less guesswork. We know how painful it is to juggle customer security reviews, infrastructure complexity, and the grind of manual evidence gathering. That's why we built [Openlane](https://www.theopenlane.io): a lightweight, open-source alternative to bloated enterprise tools.

Backed by extensible APIs and open tooling, Openlane transforms compliance from a static, annual checkbox into a continuous, collaborative process. Whether you're just starting your compliance journey or are ready for a more mature compliance posture, Openlane provides:

- 📜 Program builder for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and custom frameworks
- 📂 Built-in support for control mapping and multi-framework alignment
- 🧠 Risk register with scoring, tracking, and easy relationship building with controls, users, or systems
- 🔄 Policy and evidence lifecycle management with task and approval flows
- 🌐 Hosted Trust Centers with custom branding and 1-click NDA coming soon!
- ⚙️ Programmatic interfaces for everything — see our [API docs](https://docs.theopenlane.io/docs/api)

Hard at work to become a trusted foundation for high-growth startups and security-conscious teams that want to build trust early -without slowing down or locking into expensive platforms, we can use your support:
