## Welcome to Openlane! ðŸ‘‹

Here at Openlane, we care about the leaders inside technology businesses who show up every day to maintain the infrastructure, platforms, and processes that keep the world in motion. These incredible humans solve problems every day with tools that just aren't optimized for the tasks they need to perform, leading to toil and distraction from *the fun part of the job*! 

We're just getting started here, but stay tuned!

The first problem set we're taking on is: Security and Compliance!
Security and Compliance can be a confusing, scary place, but when you shift into Openlane you'll be cruising your way towards those certifications in no time.
